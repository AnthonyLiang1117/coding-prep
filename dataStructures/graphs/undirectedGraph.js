Implementing a undirected graph class and storing it using an adjacency list

Graph class
- a graph is a collection of nodes that have connections between the nodes in no particular order
- has an adjacency list property that initializes as an object to later store the key value pairs
- keys will be the vertices
- values will be the connections it has from that vertex
